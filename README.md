# Shimming Database (ShimDB)

ShimDB is a collection of 1H NMR signals recorded under the application of shim coil fields and allows inference of changes to the NMR spectrum or FID depending on shim offsets.

**We strongly encourage researchers to extend ShimDB with their own subsets to stimulate developments. We offer to include raw data or links to your publications into ShimDB.**

# Subset LinearShimDB

LinearShimDB is a subset of the NMR shimming database ShimDB and contains over 9000 instances under application of **linear** shim offsets. Data is acquired on a Spinsolve 80 Carbon spectrometer (Magritek GmbH, Aachen, Germany, www.magritek.com) using a water solution with CuSO4 (5mmol/L).

LinearShimDB is part of "Deep Regression with Ensembles enables Fast, First-Order Shimming in low-field NMR" by M. Becker et al. [1].
